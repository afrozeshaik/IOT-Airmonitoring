# IOT-Airmonitoring
 * This project of mine is a part of my course Software Development for Embedded Systems.
 * Sensors attached to public vehicles gather the pollutant concentration and send to the android phone of the driver.
 * The android attaches the location and timestamp for that concentraion and sends to a central server.
 * The central server then stores the data and a HTMl file then uses google maps API to show the concentrations on the map.
 * This could be helpful for the people who are allergic to specific gases and thus can avoid that particular path on their way.
